Need to run init.m before anything else to load relevant data

==General Structure==



- Hot & Cold flow functions that give a mass flow rate and characteristic velocities for the hot and cold side
- Thermal design functions that give an effectiveness for a given design, with characteristic velocities provided by previous functions
