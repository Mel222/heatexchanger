%% Inputs

L = 0.3; %lengthof pipes m, less than 0.3
NoT = 13; %number of tubes

A_tubes = NoT*pi*(di^2)/4;


%% Calculations

mh = 0.5; % guess at mass flow rate
q = mh/rho; % volumetric flow rate

%Find velocity 

V_tube = (mh/rho)/A_tubes; %TODO check rho

%Pressure drop along tubes



dp_tube =
